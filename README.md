## Overview

This week introduces important tools and techniques for handling key-value data using maps, storing and retrieving data from files, and performing powerful data transformations using the **Java Stream API**.

---

## Topics Covered

### Day 1: Map Interface - HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap
- Storing key-value pairs
- Ordering and sorting maps
- Custom key comparators

### Day 2: File Input and Output
- Reading and writing text files using `FileReader` and `FileWriter`
- Buffered I/O for efficiency

### Day 3: Serialization and Deserialization
- Saving objects to files using `ObjectOutputStream`
- Restoring objects using `ObjectInputStream`

### Day 4: Java Streams Introduction
- Difference between Streams and Collections
- Lazy vs. eager evaluation
- Benefits of streams in data processing

### Day 5: Stream Operations (Filter, Map, Reduce)
- Functional interfaces
- Processing collections with stream pipelines
- Using `filter()`, `map()`, and `reduce()` operations

### Day 6: Working with Files using Streams
- Reading CSV and text files using streams
- Collecting, grouping, and summarizing data
